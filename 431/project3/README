Project 3: Machine learning (Pente webapp)

TODO:
  - game traces need to be stored IN ORDER. Presently, they are stored in board-position. 
    this means we are not tracking the last move and can't analyze old games.


session.hpp:
  - This library provides session functions to easily load/edit/describe the game sessions.
  
session.cpp:
  - This is a simple test program which demonstrates functions from session.hpp

wlm.hpp
  - This header file describes the State and Weight objects as well as the
    Vhat() and learning routines.

wlm.cpp
  - This is a simple test program for testing wlm.hpp

project3.cgi:
  - This will be the cgi which is called from the web. It will integrate 
    sessions, games, and provide the API to the client. 

Pente.hpp:
  - This describes the game configuration and interfaces with the learning 
    machine by providing an interface to state(). We provice a make_move()
    function by passing in the Vhat() function as a reference.
  - All Xi variables are defined here.

- games are stored in GAMES_DIRECTORY (defined in wlm.hpp) as "games/"
- "weights.txt" stores the persistent 'weights'. It is defined in wlm.hpp
