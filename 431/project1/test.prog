# Tape symbols (L)
# Input characters (subset of tape symbols)
# unsigned int (number of states) (QY=1, QN=2, etc)
# transition info for state i=0
# transition info for state 3 (skip QY + QN)
# transition info for state 4 
# ... each state has |L|+1 transition markers (|L| + 1 for blank)
# Transition marker: (next-state-q || Y || N):(char-to-write):delta ({+,-})
# 2nd-to-last-line: Input string
# last line: polynomial for n
