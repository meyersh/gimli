CSCI 375: S6.1

Study the introduction to chapter 6 and section 6.1 of the textbook.
Then do the following exercises from the end of the chapter.  Bring a
printed copy to class.

* DONE 6.1
Show using mathematical induction that a binary tree of height $h$ has
no more than $2^h$ leaf nodes.

Let $h = 0$. $2^1 = 2$, a binary tree of height 0 only a single node,
so far so good.

Let $h = 1$, $2^1 = 2$, a binary tree of height 1 has 2 leaf nodes.

Inductive step, $h = h+1$. Every level has two more leaf nodes than it's parent.

$2^h \cdot 2^1 = 2^{h+1}$ The rules of exponents support our
conclusion, and therefore proves a binary tree has no more than $2^h$
leaf nodes.



* DONE 6.3 (Give at least 2 examples)
In the pumping-lemma proof in Example 6.4, give some examples of
choices of strings $u \in L$ with $|u| \geq n$ that would not work.

The pumping lemma: There is an integer $n$ so that for every $u \in L$
with $|u| \geq n$, $u$ can be written as $u = vwxyz$, for some strings
$v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ satisfying:

1) $|wy| > 0$
2) $|wxy| \leq n$
3) for every $m \geq 0, vw^mxy^mz \in L$

$L = \{xx | x \in \{a,b\}^*\}$

** Strings that do not work:
1) $a^nb^na^nb^n$
2) $b^na^nb^nb^na^nb^n$

* DONE 6.4
In the proof given in example 6.4 using the pumping lemma, the
contradiction was obtained in each case by considering the string
$vw^0xy^0z$. Would it have been possible instead to use $vw^2xy^2z$ in
each case? If so, give the proof in at least one case; if not, explain
why not.

The pumping lemma: There is an integer $n$ so that for every $u \in L$
with $|u| \geq n$, $u$ can be written as $u = vwxyz$, for some strings
$v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ satisfying:

1) $|wy| > 0$
2) $|wxy| \leq n$
3) for every $m \geq 0, vw^mxy^mz \in L$

$L = \{xx | x \in \{a,b\}^*\}$

According to the example, when $u = a^nb^na^nb^n$, the string $wxy$
covers only one set of a's, either the left or the right. Therefore,
$vw^0xy^0z = a^ib^ja^nb^n$ or $vw^0xy^0z = a^nb^ia^ia^n$.

Because we're guaranteed to cover at most one side, and the language
requires the sides to me symmetrical, pumping this to any value $\neq$
1 will produce a string not in the language.
