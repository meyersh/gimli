* 1.17 c
In each case below, say whether the indicated function is one-to-one
and what its range is.
-  c. $s:N \rightarrow N$ defined by $s(x)=m(x)+M(x)$

This function is one-to-one with a range of $x \geq 2$.

* 1.18
Find a formula for a function from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ that is a bijection.


- One may simple map 0 to 0, all negative numbers in $\mathbb{Z}$ to
  the odd numbers in $\mathbb{N}$, and all positive numbers in
  $\mathbb{Z} to the even numbers in $\mathbb{N}$.

  Therefore:

  $\text{let } z \in \mathbb{Z}$,

\[
n(z) =

* 1.26
Let $R$ be a relation on a set $S$. Write three quantified statements
(the domain being $S$ in each case), which say, respectively, that $R$ is
not reflexive, $R$ is not symmetric, and R is not transitive.

- $x \in S$, $(x,x) \not \in R$
- $x,y \in S$, $(x,y) \in R, (y,x) \not \in R$ 
- $x,y,z \in S$, $(x,y) \in R, (y,z) \in R, (x,z) \not \in R$.

* TODO 1.28 (all parts)
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets, $f:A \rightarrow B$ is a function, and
$R$ is the relation on $A$ so that for $x,y \in A$, $xRy$ if and only
if $f(x)=f(y)$.

- a. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$.  

$xRy$ if $f(x)=f(y)$, therefore $xRx$ because $f(x)=f(x)$. R is reflexive.

If $xRy$ if $f(x)=f(y)$ then $xRy$ because $f(y)=f(x)$. R is symmetric.

If $f(x)=f(y)=f(z)$, and $x \in R$, $xRy$ and $yRz$ implies $xRz$. R
is transitive.

Because R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive this means it is an
\emph{equivalence} relation

- b. If $A=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$, $B=\mathbb{N}$, and $f(x)=(x-3)^2$ for every
  $x \in A$, how many equivalence classes are there, and what are the
  elements of each one?

  For an equivalence relation $R$ on a set $A$, and an element $x \in
  A$, the equivalence class containing $x$ is $[x]_R = \{y \in A |
  yRx\}$

  There are 6 equivalence classes:
  - $|x|_0 = \{0, 6\}$

  - $|x|_1 = \{1, 4\}$

  - $|x|_2 = \{2, 4\}$

  - $|x|_3 = \{0\}$

  - $|x|_7 = \{7\}$

  - $|x|_8 = \{8\}$

- c. Suppose $A$ has $p$ elements and $B$ has $q$ elements. If the
  function $f$ is one-to-one (not necessarily onto), how many
  equivalence classes does the equivalence relation $R$ have? If the
  function $f$ is onto (not necessarily one-to-one), how many
  equivalence classes does R have?

  - If $f(x)$ is one-to-one, $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$, therefore
    no two numbers will be functionally equivalent and $R$ will have
    $p \cdot q$ elements.

  - If $f(x)$ is onto, $f(x) = f(y)$ does not imply $x = y$, therefore
    multiple numbers may be functionally equivalent and $|R| \leq p
    \cdot q$.

* 1.36 a
- a. Consider the language $L$ of all strings of a’s and b’s that
  do not end with $b$ and do not contain the substring $bb$. Find a finite
  language $S$ such that $L = S^{\ast}$.

  1. $a \in S$

  2. $x \in \{a,b\}, xa \in S$

  3. $x,y \in S, xy \in S$

* 1.45
Prove using mathematical induction that for every nonnegative integer
$n$, 

$\displaystyle\sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{1}{i(i + 1)} = \frac{n}{n+1}$ 

(If n = 0, the sum on the left is 0 by definition.)

\emph{Proof.} Let n = 1. $\frac{1}{1(1+1)} = \frac{1}{1+1}$. The formula holds for $n=1$. 

Let n = k. $\frac{1}{1(k+1)} = \frac{k}{k+1}$. The formula holds for $n=k$.

Show that it is true for $k+1$. 

$\frac{k}{k(k+1)} + \frac{k+1}{(k+1)((k+1)+1)} = \frac{k+1}{(k+1)+1}$

$(\frac{1}{(k+1)})(\frac{1}{k}+\frac{k+1}{k+2}) = \frac{k+1}{(k+1)+1}$

$\frac{2(k+1)}{k(k+2)(k+1)} = \frac{k+1}{(k+1)+1}$

$\frac{2}{k(k+2)} = \frac{k+1}{(k+1)+1}$

$\therefore$ the formula holds for $k+1$ and for all $k$.

$\blacksquare$

The numbers $a_n$, for $n \geq 0$, are defined recursively as
follows. 

$a_0 =-2$; $a_1 =-2$; for $n \geq 2$, $a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}$ 

Use strong induction to show that for every $n \geq 0$, $a_n = 2 \cdot
3^n-4*2^n$. (Refer to Example 1.24.)

Basis step.
- $n=0, a_0 = 2 \cdot 3^0 - 4 \cdot 2^0 = 2 - 4 = -2$
- $n=1, a_1 = 2 \cdot 3^1 - 4 \cdot 2^1 = 2 - 4 = -2$
- $a_2 = 5a_1 - 6a_0 = 5(-2) - 6(-2) = -10 + 12 = 2$

The property holds for $n \leq 3$.

Because $a_{(n \geq 2)}$ is built from $a_{(n-1)}$ and $a_{(n-2)}$, if the
property holds for $n-1$ and $n-2$ it holds for all $n$.

A simple calculation demonstrates that the property holds for $a_3$,
therefore the property holds for all $a_n$ which are derived from
these base factors. $\blacksquare$
* 1.61
Find a recursive definition for the language $L = \{a^ib^j | i \leq j
\leq 2i\}$, and show that it is correct (i.e., show that the language
described by the recursive definition is precisely $L$). In order to
come up with a recursive definition, it may be helpful to start with
recursive definitions for each of the languages $\{a^ib^i | i \geq
0\}$ and $\{a^ib^{2i} | i \geq 0\}$.

1. $\lambda \in L$
2. $x \in L, axb \in L$
3. $x \in L, axbb \in L$

Rule 1 will always add 1 a and 1 b.

Additionally, because we only add b's at a maximum of 2a, we'll never
have $N_b(x) > 2\cdot N_a(x)$.

Therefore, everything in $L_{\text{rd}} \in L$

It is also not possible to have a string in $L$ that cannot be created
by the recursive definition ($L_{\text{rd}}$).

\emph{Proof.} 


** Case 1: Same number of a's and b's
1. $x \in L$
2. $N_a(x) = N_b(x)$
3. $x = ayb, y \in L$

** Case 2: Fewer a's than b's
1. $x \in L$
2. $N_a(x) < N_b(x)$
3. $x = aybb, y \in L$ 
   - 3.1. $N_a(y) \leq N_b(y)$. 

While $|x| > 0$, case 1 or Case 2 may always be applied. Therefore,
there is no string in $L$ which has not been generated by
$L_{\text{rd}}$ \blacksquare
