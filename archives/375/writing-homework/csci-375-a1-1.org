Do the following exercises from the end of chapter 1 of the textbook.

* DONE 1.1 d
In each case below, construct a truth table for the statement and find
another statement with at most one operator (\vee, \wedge, \not, or
\rightarrow ) that is logically equivalent.

- d. (p \rightarrow q ) \wedge (\not p \rightarrow q )

  |   |   | 1               | 4      | 2      | 3                    |
  | p | q | p \rightarrow q | \wedge | \not p | \not p \rightarrow q |
  | F | F | T               | F      | T      | F                    |
  | F | T | T               | T      | T      | T                    |
  | T | F | F               | F      | F      | T                    |
  | T | T | T               | T      | F      | T                    |

Logically equilvalant truth table:

| p | q | o |
| F | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| T | T | T |

A logically equilvalent statement is q \wedge q.

* DONE 1.3

Suppose m_1 and m_2 are integers representing months $(1 \leq m_i \leq
12)$, and d_{1} and d_{2} are integers representing days (d_i is at least 1
and no larger than the number of days in month m_{i}). For each i, the
pair (m_{i},d_{i}) can be thought of as representing a date; for
example, (9,18) represents September 18. We wish to write a logical
proposition involving the four integers that says (m_{1},d_{1}) comes
before (m_{2},d_{2}) in the calendar.

- a. Find such a proposition that is a disjunction of two propositions
  (i.e., combines them using \vee).

  $\neg(m_i \geq m_{i+1} \vee d_i \geq d_{i+1})$


- b. Find such a proposition that is a conjunction of two propositions
  (combines them using \wedge).

  $m_i < m_{i+1} \wedge d_i < d_{i+1}$

* DONE 1.4 b, f
  In each case below, say whether the statement is a tautology, a
  contradiction, or neither.

  - b. p \wedge \not (p \rightarrow p)

    | p | \wedge | \not (p \rightarrow p) |
    | F | F      | F                      |
    | T | F      | F                      | 

    This statement is a contradiction.

  - f. (p \wedge q) \vee (\not p) \vee (\not q)

    | p | q | (p \wedge q) | \vee | \not p \vee \not q |
    | F | F | F            | T    | T                  |
    | F | T | F            | T    | T                  |
    | T | F | F            | T    | T                  |
    | T | T | T            | T    | F                  |

    This statement is a tautology.

* DONE 1.7 c
  Describe each of the following infinite sets using set builder
  notation.

  - c. {\{0}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, {0,1,2,3}, \cdots }

    $\displaystyle\bigcup_{i \in N}\{\{n\} : n \leq i,  n \in N\}$

* DONE 1.8 a, c
  In each case below, find an expression for the indicated set,
  involving A, B, C, and any of the operations \cup , \cap , $-$, and $'$.

  - a. {x | x \in A or x \in B but not both}

    $A \cup B - A \cap B$

  - c. {x | x is an element of at most one of the three sets A, B, and C}
    
    $A \cup B \cup C - A \cap B - A \cap C - B \cap C$
    
* DONE 1.9 a, b, g, h

  For each integer n, denote by C_n the set of all real numbers less
  than n, and for each positive number n let D_n be the set of all
  real numbers ess than 1/n. Express each of the following unions or
  intersections in a simpler way. For example, the answer to (a) is
  c_{10}. The answer is not always on of the sets C_i or D_i, but
  there is an equally simple answer in each case. Since \infty is
  not a number, the expressions C_{\infty} and D_{\infty} do not
  make sense and should not appear in your answers.

  - a. $\bigcup\{C_n | 1 \leq n \leq 10\}$

    C_{10}

  - b. $\bigcup\{D_n | 1 \leq n \leq 10\}$
    
    D_{1}

  - g. $\bigcap\{C_n | 1 \leq n\}$

    $D_{1}'$

  - h. $\bigcap\{D_n | 1 \leq n\}$

    $C_{1}$

* DONE 1.11 a, d
In each case below, say whether the given statement is true for the
universe $(0,1) = \{x \in R : 0 < x < 1\}$, and say whether
it is true for the universe $[0,1] = \{x \in R : 0 \leq x
\leq 1\}$. For each of the cases, you should therefore give two
true-or-false answers.

  - a. $\forall_{x}(\exists_{y}(x \gt y))$

    For all x, there exists a $y$ where $x > y$. 

    $(0,1)$ - True. For every number > 0, there exists a number slightly closer to 0.

    $[0,1]$ - False. At 0, there is no smaller number in this domain. 

  - d. $\exists_{y}(\forall_{x}(x \geq y))$
  
    There exists y, such that all $x \geq y$.

    $(0,1)$ - False, there is always a number slightly closer to zero.

    $[0,1]$ - True, there exists 0 and all x is $\geq$ to it. 

* DONE 1.12
- a. How many elements are there in the set \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\},
  \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}, \{\emptyset, \{\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\},
  \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}\}\}\}
  
  The cardinality of the set is $4$.

- b. Describe precisely the algorithm you used to answer part (a).

  I view this set as:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  { {}, 
    {0}, 
    {0, {0}}, 
    {0, { {0,{0},{0, {0}}}}} 
  } 
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This shows that there are four slots, one $\emptyset$, shown as an
  empty set, and three sets (of $\emptyset$'s). I do not count the
  first empty set and do not count members of any 'child' sets.

* DONE 1.15a
Suppose that A and B are subsets of a universal set U.
- a. What is the relationship between 2^{A \cup B} and 2^A \cup 2^B ?
  (Under what circumstances are they equal? If they are not equal, is
  one necessarily a subset of the other, and if so, which one?) Give
  reasons for your answers.

  The relationship is $2^A \cup 2^B \subseteq 2^{A \cup B}$

  * Under what circumstances are they equal?
    
    $2^{A \cup B} = 2^A \cup 2^B$ when $A = B$.

  * If they are not equal, is one necessarily a subset of the other, and if so, which one?

    Yes, one is a subset because in $2^{A \cup B}$ will invariably
    contain A and B. It will also possess sets containing elements of
    both A and B intermixed which would not be present in $2^A \cup
    2^B$.
    
* DONE 1.38 (all parts)

In each case below, write a quantified statement, using the formal
notation discussed in the chapter, that expresses the given
statement. In both cases the set A is assumed to be a subset of the
domain, not necessarily the entire domain.

- a. There are at least two distinct elements in the set A satisfying
  the condition P(i.e., for which the proposition P(x) holds).

  $x,y \in A \wedge \exists_{x,y}(P(x) \wedge P(y))$

- b. There is exactly one element x in the set A satisfying the condition P.

  $x,y \in A \wedge \exists_{x}(P(x)) \wedge \neg \exists_{x,y}(P(x) \wedge P(y) \wedge x \neq y))$

* DONE 1.54

Prove that for every positive integer $n$, there is a nonnegative
integer $i$ and an odd integer $j$ so that $n = 2^i \cdot j$.

Odd numbers:

1. multiplicative identity, which says $n*1 = n$.

2. Any number raised to the 0th power is 1, therefore any odd number
   may be represented by $2^0 * n = n$

Powers of two:

1. multiplicative identity, which says $n*1 = n$.

2. Therefore, any power of two may be expressed as $2^i * 1 = n$

Even numbers:

1. Let us define a number as even if there exists an integer $k$ so that $n=2k$.

2. Let us define a number as odd if there exists an integer $l$ such that $n = 2l+1$

3. If a number has no odd factors, it is a power of two (see above rule)

4. Even numbers that are non-powers of two, must possess an odd factor. $n = 2(2l + 1)$.

5. Factoring: $n = 4l + 4 = 4(l+1)$ 

6. Therefore, all even (non power-of-two) numbers may be represented as $n = 2^2*(l+1)$.
