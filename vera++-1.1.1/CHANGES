Vera++ 1.1.0 differs from 1.0.0 in the following ways:

- Updated rules:
  - T002: additionally recognizes redefinition (#define) of keywords
  - T009: recognizes comment adjacent to colon as an exception to the rule

- Added rules:
  - F001: Source files should not use the '\r' (CR) character
  - F002: File names should be well-formed
          Note: F002 is not part of the default profile.
  - T012: Negation operator should not be used in its short form
  - T013: Source files should contain the copyright notice
  - T014: Source files should refer the Boost Software License
          Note: T014 is not part of the default profile.
  - T015: HTML links in comments and string literals should be correct
  - T016: Calls to min/max should be protected against accidental
          macro substitution
  - T017: Unnamed namespaces are not allowed in header files
  - T018: Using namespace is not allowed in header files
  - T019: Control structures should have complete curly-braced block of code

- Added predefined boost profile to emulate the original Boost inspect tool.

- Added transformations:
  - move_namespace: Changes the given identifier, useful for moving the whole
    project from one namespace to another.
  - move_macros: Changes the given prefix in all identifiers,
    useful for moving the whole set of macros that have common prefix.
  - move_includes: Changes the given part of #include "..." directives,
    useful for moving libraries and whole sets of header files.

- Added documentation for all available transformations.

- Makefiles modified to better support Windows make users.

- Extension .ipp added to the list of recognized source file extensions.

- New option -showrules includes name of rules in each report line.

- Changed the profile definition to be an active Tcl script
  instead of passive text file.

- Added the possibility to define exclusions to rule checks.

- BUGFIX: Corrected handling of newline tokens.
