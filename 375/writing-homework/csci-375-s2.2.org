CSCI 375: S2.2

Study  sections 2.3 and 2.4 of the textbook.  Then do the following exercises from the end of the
chapter.  Bring a printed copy to class.

* 2.17

Let $L$ be the language $AnBn = \{a^nb^n | n \geq 0\}$.

- a. Find two distinct strings $x$ and $y$ in $\{a,b\}^*$ that are not
  $L$-distinguishable

- b. Find an infinite set of pairwise $L$-distinguishable strings.

* 2.23

By ignoring some of the details in the statement of the pumping lemma,
we can easily get these two weaker statements.

I. If $L \subseteq \epsilon^*$ is an infinite language that can be
accepted by an FA, then there are strings $u$, $v$, and $w$ such that
$|v| > 0$ and $uv^iw \in L$ for every $i \geq 0$.

II. If $L \subseteq \epsilon^*$ is an infinite language that can be
accepted by an FA, then there are integers $p$ and $q$ such that $q >
0$ and for every $i \geq 0, L$ contains a string of length $p + iq$.

For each language $L$, decide whether statement II is enough to show
that $l$ cannot be accepted by an FA, and explain your answer. If
statement II is not sufficient, decide whether statement I is, and
explain your answer.

** 2.23 a
   
   - $L = \{a^nba^{2n} | n \geq 0\}$

     hense.

** 2.23 c

   - $L = \{a^ib^j | j = i$ or $j = 2i\}$

     thus.

** 2.23 h

   - $L = \{ww | w \in \{a,b\}^*\}$

     therefore.
