CSCI 375: S3.2

Read sections 3.2-3.3 of the textbook.  Then do the following
exercises from the end of the chapter.  Bring a printed copy to class.

* 3.18 a, b, c

Figure 3.34, at the bottom of this page, shows a transition diagram for
an NFA. For each string below, say whether the NFA accepts it.

- A) $aba$

The NFA could accept this string because there is a
non-determininistic compute path to state 5 (1 $\rightarrow$ 2
$\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow \Lambda$ 5)

- B) $abab$

The NFA could accept this string because there is a non-deterministic
compute path to state 5 (1 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow \Lambda$ 3
$\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow \Lambda$ 5)

- C) $aaabbb$

The NFA could accept this string because there is a non-deterministic
compute path for the prefix $aa$ to state 4 which has a
$\Lambda$-transition into accepting state 5.

* 3.33
Give an example of a regular language $L$ containing $\Lambda$ that
cannot be accepted by any NFA having only one accepting state and no
$\Lambda$-transitions, and show that your answer is correct.

- Let $L = a^*b^*$. Note that this includes the nullstring.  An FA
  accepting this language is:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2cm]
\node [initial, state, accepting] (q0) {q0};
\node [state] (q1) [right of=q0] {q1};
\node [state,accepting] (q2) [below right of=q0] {q2};

\path[->] (q0) edge [loop above] node {a} (q0)
          (q0) edge              node {b} (q1)
          (q1) edge              node {a} (q2) 
          (q1) edge [loop above] node {b} (q1)
          (q2) edge [loop right] node {a,b} (q2);

\end{tikzpicture}
#+END_LaTeX

Because $L$ contains the nullstring, $q0$ must be an accepting
state. However, because $L$ contains non-null strings, there must be a
second accepting state for those. Thus, this regular language cannot
be accepted by an NFA without multiple accepting states or a
$\Lambda$-transition.
