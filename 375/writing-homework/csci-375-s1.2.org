* 1.16 (Both parts)

Suppose A and B are finite sets, A has n elements and $f$ : A \rightarrow B.

** a. If f is one-to-one, what can you say about the number of elements of B?

   If $f$ is one-to-one, $|B| \geq |A|$ because B will never have
   fewer elements than A, but there is no restriction saying $f$ can't return
   multiple values.

** b. If f is onto, what can you say about the number of elements of B?

   If $f$ is onto, $|B| \leq |A|$ because $f(x) = f(y)$ does not mean $x = y$.

* 1.17 A, B

In each case below, say whether the indicated function is one-to-one and what its range is.

** a. m :  N \rightarrow N defined by m(x) = min(x,2)

Per mathworld, Minimum is the smallest value of a set. In this case,
every x \in N will be compared to 2. Because there are multiple
natural numbers \lt 2, this is \emph{not} a one-to-one function.

Its range is $\{ x \in N$ where $x \leq 2\}$

** b. M : N \rightarrow N defined by M(x) = max(x,2)

Per mathworld, Maximum is the largest value of a set. In this case,
every x \in N will be compared to 2. Because there are multiple
natural numbers \gt 2, this is \emph{not} a one-to-one function.

Its range is $\{ x \in N$ where $x \geq 2\}$

* 1.23 (All parts)

In each case below, a relation on the set {1, 2, 3} is given. Of the
three properties, reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, determine
which ones the relation has. Give reasons.

** a. R = {(1,3), (3,1), (2,2)}
   -  R is reflexive if: For every x \in A, xRx. Because not all relate to
      themselves (1,1), etc, R is \emph{not reflexive}.

   -  R is symmetric if: For every x and every y in A, if xRy then yRx.
      (1,3) \rightarrow (3,1)
      (2,2) \rightarrow (2,2)

      Therefore, R is symmetric.

   - R is transitive if: For every x, every y, and every z in A, if xRy
     and yRz, then xRz.

     If (1,3) = (x,y) and (3,1) = (y,z), we need another with
     (x,z) = (1,1). 

     Therefore, R is \emph{not} transitive.
     
** b. R = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2)}
   - This is a reflexive, non-symmetric, transitive relation on
     {1,2,3} containing as few ordered pairs as possible.

     Per 2.24, we can verify that the relation is transitive. If x, y,
     and z are elements of {1, 2, 3} such that (x,y) and (y,z) are
     in R, then at least one of the statements x=y and y=z must be
     true, and it follows that (x,y) is in R.

** c. R = \emptyset
   -  R is reflexive if: For every x \in A, xRx 

      Well, no x from A is in this relation to relate to itself. R is
      neither reflexive nor non-reflexive.

   -  R is symmetric if: For every x and every y in A, if xRy then yRx.
      
      No x or y from A is in this relation to not relate
      symmetrically. Therefore, R is symmetric.

   -  R is transitive if: For every x, every y, and every z in A, if xRy
      and yRz, then xRz.

      No x, y, or z are from A to be fail to be transitive to. Therefore, R is
      transitive.

* 1.32

For a finite language L, let |L| denote the number of elements of
L. For example, |{\Lambda, a, ababb}| = 3. This notation has nothing
to do with the length |x| of a string x. The statement |L_{1}L_2|
= |L_1||L_2| says that the number of strings in the concatenation
L_{1}L_2 is the same as the product of the two numbers |L_1|
and |L_2|. Is this always true? If so, give reasons, and if not, find
two finite languages L_1, L_2 \subseteq {a, b}\ast such that |L_{1}L_2|
\neq |L_1||L_2|.

It is not always true. 

- Ex. 2 L_1 = {a, aa} L_2 = {b, ab}

  L_{1}L_2 = {ab, aab, aab, aaab}

  Because sets cannot have duplicates, this collapses down to:

  L_{1}L_2 = {ab, aab, aaab} with a cardinality of 3 instead of the
  expected 4 (2 \cdot 2).
