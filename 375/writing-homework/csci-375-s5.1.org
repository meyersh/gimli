CSCI 375: S5.1 

Study the introduction to chapter 5 and sections 5.1-5.2 of the
textbook.  Then do the following exercises from the end of the
chapter.  Bring a printed copy to class.

* 5.1a
  For the PDA in Table 5.4, trace the sequence of moves made for the
  following input strings:

** string ab
$(q_0, ab, Z_0) \vdash (q_1, b, aZ_0) \vdash (q_2, \Lambda, Z_0) \vdash (q_3, \Lambda, Z_0)$

** string aab
$(q_0, aab, Z_0) \vdash (q_1, ab, aZ_0) \vdash (q_1, b, aaZ_0) \vdash (q_2, \Lambda, aZ_0) \vdash (q_3, \Lambda, aZ_0)$

We are not in an accepting state because the string has not been fully processed (the stack is not empty.). 

** string abb
$(q_0, abb, Z_0) \vdash (q_1, bb, aZ_0) \vdash (q_2, b, aZ_0) \vdash (q_2, b, Z_0) \vdash$ No move.

We have consumed as much of the string as possible, but have not moves left for the configuration we are in.

* 5.1b 
  For the PDA in table 5.6, trace the sequence of moves made for the
  following input string:

** string baca
$(q_0, baca, Z_0) \vdash (q_0, aca, bZ_0) \vdash (q_0, ca, abZ_0) \vdash (q_1, a, abZ_0) \vdash (q_2, \Lambda, bZ_0)$

We are not in an accepting state because there are unprocessed
elements on the stack.
