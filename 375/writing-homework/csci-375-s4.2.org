CSCI 375: S4.2

Read section 4.4 of the textbook.  Then do the following exercises
from the end of the chapter.  Bring a printed copy to class.

* 4.33
Consider the C statements

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{verbatim}
x = 1; 

if (a > 2) 
  if (a > 4) 
    x = 2; 
  else x = 3;
\end{verbatim}
#+END_LaTeX

- a. What is the resulting value of $x$ if these statements are
  interpreted according to the derivation tree in Figure 4.21a and $a
  = 3$?

$x = 3$. The first if branch matches, the second fails and we process
its else condition.

- b. Same question as in (a), but when $a=1$.

$x = 1$ because the first if statement does not match and the other
conditionals are under its tree.

- c. What is the resulting value of $x$ if these statements are
  interpreted according to the derivation tree in Figure 4.21b and $a
  = 3$?

$x = 1$ because the else is considered part of the top-level
if-statement and because it does not match, x remains 1.

- d. Same question as in (c), but when $a = 1$.

$x = 3$ because the else is considered part of the top-level if in
4.21b.
